Project Overview:
This project aims to provide a dynamic and secure User Interface (UI) for managing users, roles, and permissions within a system. It is designed for administrators to efficiently manage users and roles, assign permissions, and ensure a secure and organized management system.

Features - 
User Management:

View, add, edit, and delete users.
Assign roles to users.
Manage user status (Active/Inactive).
Role Management:

Create, view, edit, and delete roles.
Define and modify roles with associated permissions (Read, Write, Delete, etc.).
Dynamic Permissions:

Assign and modify permissions for roles.
Easily view and manage role permissions through an intuitive interface.
Custom API Simulation (Optional):

Mock API calls to simulate CRUD operations for users and roles.
Technologies Used
Frontend Framework: React (or Angular/Vue depending on your choice)
State Management: Redux (optional for advanced state management)
Styling: CSS/SCSS or libraries like TailwindCSS or Material UI for responsive design
Mock API: JSON Server or Axios to simulate server communication (optional)
Database: Mocked in memory or using a simple local JSON file for persistence (if needed)
Version Control: Git & GitHub for source code management

Permissions Management:

Modify role permissions dynamically through the UI.
Responsive Design:

The UI adjusts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Security Features
Input validation is implemented to ensure that only valid data is submitted.
Error handling for form submissions and API requests.
Data sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
Optional Features
Sorting and Filtering:

Users and roles can be sorted or filtered based on different attributes like role name or user status.
Search Functionality:

Quickly find users, roles, or permissions by searching for specific keywords.
Audit Log (Bonus):

Track changes made to users, roles, or permissions, providing a history of modifications for security purposes.
Additional Features
Custom API Simulation:
Mock API calls using tools like JSON Server or Axios to simulate a backend.
Authentication (Bonus):
Implement authentication and authorization features for secure admin access.
